# Internet-Technology-Timeline
📌 Project Title:
📆 Evolution of Internet & Technology – HTML & CSS Timeline

📝 Description:
This is a simple yet visually engaging vertical timeline built using pure HTML and CSS, inspired by a graphic originally designed on Venngage.
🖼️ The timeline visually represents the major milestones in the evolution of the internet and technology — from the birth of the World Wide Web to the rise of mobile networks powered by renewable energy.
What makes this project unique is that the original timeline was intended for static graphic use, but I challenged myself to bring it to life as a fully coded, browser-friendly component — with:

->Semantic HTML structure
->Clean and responsive CSS layout
->Iconography powered by Flaticon

🚀 Features:
->Pure HTML & CSS (no JS or frameworks)
->Vertical responsive layout
->Icon-enhanced event markers
->Lightweight and fast-loading
->Easily extendable for new events or themes

🔧 Technologies Used:
->HTML5
->CSS3
->Flaticon (for event icons)
